# Input Device Tests

This directory contains MicroPython test scripts for various input devices and user interface components, designed for ESP32 microcontrollers.

## Development Environment

- **IDE**: Thonny IDE
- **Language**: MicroPython
- **Target Hardware**: ESP32 microcontrollers
- **Purpose**: Test scripts for verifying input device functionality

## Available Tests

- `Button-LED.py` - Test for button with LED feedback
- `Button-Only.py` - Test for basic button input
- `Joystick-test.py` - Test for joystick input
- `Mouse-scroll.py` - Test for mouse scroll functionality
- `Color-test.py` - Test for color sensor input

## Requirements

- Thonny IDE with MicroPython support
- ESP32 microcontroller with MicroPython firmware
- Required MicroPython packages (machine, time, etc.)
- Specific hardware components as listed in each test file

## Usage

1. Open the desired test script in Thonny IDE
2. Connect your ESP32 to the computer
3. Select the ESP32 as the interpreter in Thonny
4. Run the script using the Run button in Thonny

Make sure to connect the appropriate input devices before running the tests.
