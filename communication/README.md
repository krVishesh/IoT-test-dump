# Communication Tests

This directory contains MicroPython test scripts for various wireless communication protocols and interfaces, designed for ESP32 microcontrollers.

## Development Environment

- **IDE**: Thonny IDE
- **Language**: MicroPython
- **Target Hardware**: ESP32 microcontrollers
- **Purpose**: Test scripts for verifying wireless communication functionality

## Available Tests

- `WIFI-Test.py` - Test for WiFi connectivity
- `ESP-Now-Receiver-RC.py` - Test for ESP-Now protocol receiver
- `API-Test.py` - Test for API communication
- `RFID-Test-READ.py` - Test for RFID communication

## Requirements

- Thonny IDE with MicroPython support
- ESP32 microcontroller with MicroPython firmware
- Required MicroPython packages (network, espnow, etc.)
- Specific hardware components as listed in each test file

## Usage

1. Open the desired test script in Thonny IDE
2. Connect your ESP32 to the computer
3. Select the ESP32 as the interpreter in Thonny
4. Run the script using the Run button in Thonny

Make sure to configure the appropriate network settings and connect the required hardware components before running the tests.
