# Storage Tests

This directory contains MicroPython test scripts for storage-related operations and SD card functionality, designed for ESP32 microcontrollers.

## Development Environment

- **IDE**: Thonny IDE
- **Language**: MicroPython
- **Target Hardware**: ESP32 microcontrollers
- **Purpose**: Test scripts for verifying storage and file system functionality

## Available Tests

- `SD-Card.py` - Test for basic SD card operations
- `Check-File-Size.py` - Test for file size checking
- `SD-Audio.py` - Test for audio file handling on SD card

## Requirements

- Thonny IDE with MicroPython support
- ESP32 microcontroller with MicroPython firmware
- Required MicroPython packages (machine, sdcard, etc.)
- Specific hardware components as listed in each test file

## Usage

1. Open the desired test script in Thonny IDE
2. Connect your ESP32 to the computer
3. Select the ESP32 as the interpreter in Thonny
4. Run the script using the Run button in Thonny

Make sure to have an SD card properly inserted and formatted before running the tests.
